# School and Neighborhood Reference Tool

Many tools for analyzing statistics on public schools exist, however data on private schools is more scarce. This website provides a single interactive map for displaying school and tract-level neighborhood data. The school data is from the Private School Universe Survey (PSUS) and the neighborhood statistics are from the American Community Survey (ACS). Only the northern Virginia area is included in the static map to keep the file sizes reasonable, but users can select any counties and any variable from the ACS for display.
